# Week 2 - Titanic Survival Classification

This project is part of my AI Engineer learning roadmap. The goal is to explore the Titanic dataset and build a classification model to predict survival using Python and common machine learning tools.

##  Project Overview

- Dataset: Titanic (from seaborn / Kaggle)
- Objective: Predict whether a passenger survived or not
- Tasks:
  - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Handle missing values and encode categorical features
  - Visualize key patterns (e.g., age, sex, class)
  - Train a Logistic Regression classifier
  - Evaluate model performance

##  Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.10+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, NumPy
- seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn

##  Key Results

- Logistic Regression model trained on selected features
- Visualizations show survival patterns by age, sex, class
